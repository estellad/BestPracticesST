## Additional acknowledgments

- The 'Best Practices for Spatial Transcriptomics Analysis with Bioconductor' online book is inspired by the [Orchestrating Single-Cell Analysis with Bioconductor (OSCA)](https://bioconductor.org/books/release/OSCA/) online book [@Amezquita2020], which provides a detailed overview and examples of analysis workflows for single-cell RNA sequencing data using R and Bioconductor.

- We are especially grateful to the [Bioconductor](https://bioconductor.org/) community and the [Bioconductor Core Team](https://www.bioconductor.org/about/core-team/).
