# Spatial co-localization {#sec-spatial-co-localization}


## Overview

In this chapter, we will show examples of analyses to investigate spatial co-localization of cell types.

For these analyses, we will use a different dataset that provides single-cell spatial resolution, e.g. from the 10x Genomics Xenium platform.


## Previous steps

*Code to run steps from the previous chapters to generate the `SpatialExperiment` object required for this chapter.*

## Spatial co-localization of cell types within a single sample

We will use the [spicyR](https://bioconductor.org/packages/spicyR) Bioconductor package [@Canete2022] for the following examples.
