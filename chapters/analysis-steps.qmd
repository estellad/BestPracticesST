# Analysis steps {#sec-analysis-steps}

This part contains chapters describing individual analysis steps within computational analysis workflows for spatial transcriptomics data.

Each chapter describes the analysis type, including discussion on statistical issues and available methods, and provides an interactive example with R code and an example dataset.

In the next chapter, we load a dataset in `SpatialExperiment` format (see @sec-bioconductor-data-classes), which will be used in several of the subsequent chapters.

For examples of complete analysis workflows for selected datasets and technological platforms, see the next part (@sec-workflows).
