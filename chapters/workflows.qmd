# Workflows {#sec-workflows}

This part contains several extended chapters containing complete analysis workflows.

Each chapter uses a specific example dataset and a selected set of analysis methods. The workflows have been selected to showcase certain types of analyses or datasets from a specific technological platform. Each workflow includes some discussion on the types of analyses and methods used, and interactive R code examples.

For more details on the individual analysis steps, see the chapters in the previous part (@sec-analysis-workflows).
